*create a standard for the movement data sent between phones and server
*Would it be too slow for us to grab "images" of the game from the web
server?
*Is it actually possible to grab accelerometer data with any accuracy
from the Wiimote? Maybe more importantly, can the Android accelerometer
work better for this?
*First thing: get data from the Wiimote to begin looking at what it
contains. This means making an app to collect data from a bluetooth
connection.
*Standards: court size, movement data between server-phones, displays,
stuff running on phones, where to wear Wiimote
*common interface between Android and iPhone
