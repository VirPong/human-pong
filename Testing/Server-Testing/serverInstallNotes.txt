Installation:
NODE & NPM:
*does not mention MySQL
*no mention of PHP
*failed to mention that certain components need to be installed:
	- build-essential
	- libssl-dev
*would have like to see sources (urls) for the various instructions 
*instructions for npm installation of express and socket.io was unhelpful with 
	instruction to "cd <your directory name>" DIRECTORY FOR WHAT?
*node and npm instructions worked in end

MONGO DB:
*documentation wants 64-bit, not correct for all systems
*documentation wanted a download of mongodb then use package manager to 
	install.  This seems redundant.  Also, the downloaded package 
	never gets used.	   
*seemed to complete fine, but the discussion paragraph leads me confused
*the mongodb sections seemed confused with downloading packages and then 
     using the package manager's install features.
