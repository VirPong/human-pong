\noindent \textbf{Test Case:} Update player scores-Client1 scores 1 point\\
\textbf{Version:}1.0\\
\textbf{Description:} This will test if any defects appear when a client scores a point.  When the game logic determines no collision, the system will increment the point winner's score.\\
\textbf{Pre-conditions:} System Operational, Client1 and Client2 logged in and participating in game \\
\textbf{Post-conditions:} Game continues\\
\textbf{Scenario:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Client1 moves to hit the ball.
\item Game logic determines ball movement.
\item Client2 does not move 
\item Game logic determines no collision. 
\item Game logic pause game to informs system of client1 point.
\item System communicates point incrimination to game repository.
\item Game repository increments client1’s point.
\item Game repository communicates current score back to server.
\item Game repository sends current score to client interface.
\item Client interface displays current score
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Expected Results:} Client1 has 1 point, Client 2 has 0 points.  Game continues.\\
