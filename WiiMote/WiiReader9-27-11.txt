/**
 * Takes the acceleration data from a Wii Remote, extrapolates position
 * data, and a few other things. Still a work in progress.
 *
 * The WiiMote's axis conventions should be noted. Assume the player is
 * facing the game field, so to speak. When holding the WiiMote sideways
 * in the standard orientation (1 and 2 on the right), an acceleration to
 * the right will be a positive y acceleration. When holding the WiiMote
 * pointing forwards, an acceleration to the right will be a negative x
 * acceleration. In either case, an acceleration UPWARDS will be a positive
 * z acceleration; we incorporated this option in case the user wanted to
 * use it, but Jason may not approve because it doesn't involve running
 * around, so we'll see. Also, since lifting/lowering will match the paddle
 * position differently than moving left/right (depending on whether you're
 * player 1 or player 2), it'll be up to the phone teams who have whether
 * they're 1 or 2 to determine this.
