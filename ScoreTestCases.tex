\noindent \textbf{Test Case:} Update player scores-Client1 scores 1 point\\
\textbf{Version:}1.0\\
\textbf{Description:} This will test if any defects appear when a client scores a point.  The game logic should determine no collision, and the system should increment the point winner's score, and send the updated score to each client.\\
\textbf{Pre-conditions:} System Operational, Client1 and Client2 logged in and participating in game \\
\textbf{Post-conditions:} Game continues\\
\textbf{Scenario:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Client1 moves to hit the ball.\\
\item Game logic determines ball movement.\\
\item Client2 does not move.\\
\item Game logic determines no collision. \\
\item System should send updated score to both Client1 and Client2.\\
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Expected Results:} Client receives updated score reflected as Client1 has 1 point, Client 2 has 0 points.  Game should continue.\\
\textbf{Pass/Fail:}Fail\\
\textbf{Comment:} Due to the fact that the server does not send the updated score to the clients, boundary and functionality testing was not conducted on the score keeping.\\

\noindent \textbf{Test Case:} Game Logic- Paddle Logic Usability\\
\textbf{Version:}1.0\\
\textbf{Description:} This will test if any defects appear when a client is using the paddle to hit the ball.\\
\textbf{Pre-conditions:} System Operational, Client1 and Client2 logged in and participating in game \\
\textbf{Post-conditions:} Game continues\\
\textbf{Scenario:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Client1 moves to hit the ball.\\
\item Game logic determines collision when Client1's paddle comes in any contact with the ball. \\
\item Game logic determines ball movement.\\
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Expected Results:} Client can hit ball with any part of their paddle.\\
\textbf{Pass/Fail:}Fail\\
\textbf{Comments:} Client would like to be able to hit the ball with the side of their paddle, not just the face.\\

\noindent \textbf{Test Case:} Game Logic- Ball Logic Usability\\
\textbf{Version:}1.0\\
\textbf{Description:} This will test if any defects appear in ball when client plays a game.\\
\textbf{Pre-conditions:} System Operational, Client1 and Client2 logged in and participating in game \\
\textbf{Post-conditions:} Game continues\\
\textbf{Scenario:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Client1 moves to hit the ball.\\
\item Game logic determines collision when Client1's paddle comes in any contact with the ball. \\
\item Game logic determines ball movement.\\
\item Client2 moves to hit the ball.\\
\item Game logic determines collision when Client2's paddle comes in any contact with the ball. \\
\item Game logic determines ball movement.\\
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Expected Results:} Client finds ball movement to be logical and usable.\\
\textbf{Pass/Fail:}Pass\\
\textbf{Comments:} Client would like more diversity in initial ball movement, both in which direction the ball is served as well as to which client the ball is served.\\

\noindent \textbf{Test Case:} Between Client Latency\\
\textbf{Version:}1.0\\
\textbf{Description:} This will test if any defects appear in the latency between separate clients (both players and spectators) logged into the same game.\\
\textbf{Pre-conditions:} System Operational, Client1 and Client2 logged in and participating in game, Client3 (a spectator) is logged on watching. \\
\textbf{Post-conditions:} Game continues\\
\textbf{Scenario:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Clients continually play and watch the game from different computers.\\
\item Clients notice the latency between the computers, both from the players' and spectators' computers.\\
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Expected Results:} Client finds that the game is running simultaneously on every computer.\\
\textbf{Pass/Fail:}Pass\\
