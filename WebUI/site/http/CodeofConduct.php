<H1>Code of Conduct:</H1>
</br></br>
 
The Code of Conduct outlines the rules that you need to follow to help ensure that Vir-Pong is fun for everyone.

I. You may do the following:
- Be polite and treat others with respect. Just because you’re online doesn’t mean you should be a jerk.
- Welcome newcomers. The more people on the Services, the more fun for everyone.
- Know your privacy settings and use them to help create and control the experience you want. If you’re a parent, you can use Family Settings to control the activities and experiences available to your kid. For example, you can prohibit voice and video communication, block purchasing, and choose who your kid is allowed to play with online.
- Make friends.
- Have fun!

II Do not do the following:
- Do not use the Service to do anything illegal. You are responsible for your actions and the consequences of your actions on the service, not Vir-Pong.
- Do not harass, abuse, or spam other players, or encourage other players to do so.
- Do not scream, yell, threaten, or stalk other players, or encourage other players to do so.
- Do not create a gamertag, profile content, or other in-game content that other users may be offended by. This includes, without limitation, anything related to or suggestive of: profane words/phrases, topics of content of a sexual nature, hate speech (including but not limited to racial, ethnic, or religious slurs), illegal drugs/controlled substances, or illegal activities.
- Do not create a gamertag, profile content, or in-game content that references controversial religious topics, notorious people, organizations, or sensitive current or historical events that may be considered inappropriate.
-Do not distribute, post, publish, upload, disseminate or discuss defamatory, infringing, obscene, sexual or unlawful materials in any format (images, audio, video, text, etc.). Prohibited materials include, without limitation, child pornography or illegal drugs. “Sound alike” words or phrases or puns that reference these topics are also prohibited.
- Do not post links to websites that violate the Code of Conduct.
- Donot give out personal information of other players (such as their real name, address, phone number, credit card number, etc.) in any way (including, without limitation, through voice chat or the names you create for your gamertag or mottos). This information could be used by other players for illegal or harmful purposes. You should also avoid giving out your own personal information.
- Do not cheat in a game.
- Do not modify or hack game content to create cheats.
- Do not make unauthorized modifications to your account profile or its contents.
- Donot intentionally play with someone who is using unauthorized software or methods to help inflate your game rank.
- Do not post links to materials that could harm other users' computers or would allow others to inappropriately access software or Web sites.
- Do not lend, transfer, sell, or otherwise provide access to your account to any individual.
- Do not use your account for commercial purposes.
- Do not impersonate, harass, or defame Vir-Pong employees, moderators, or staff members.
- Donot use the forums or chats for any commercial purpose. You may only create an account for yourself as an individual. You may not create an account for your corporation or other business entity.
- Any non-game-related conversation that takes up a substantial amount of the forum or chat space and prevents users from finding game-related information may be considered a violation of the Code of Conduct.

Consequences of Violation:
If you violate the Code of Conduct you will be immediately terminated from use of Vir-Pong products.
