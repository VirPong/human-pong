<H1>Code of Conduct:</H1>
<br />
 
<p>The Code of Conduct outlines the rules that you need to follow to help ensure that Vir-Pong is fun for everyone.</p>

<p>I. You may do the following:<br />
- Be polite and treat others with respect. Just because you're online doesn't mean you should be a jerk.<br />
- Welcome newcomers. The more people on the Services, the more fun for everyone.<br />
- Know your privacy settings and use them to help create and control the experience you want. If you're a parent, you can use Family Settings to control the activities and experiences available to your kid. For example, you can prohibit voice and video communication, block purchasing, and choose who your kid is allowed to play with online.<br />
- Make friends.<br />
- Have fun!</p>

<p>II Do not do the following:<br />
- Do not use the Service to do anything illegal. You are responsible for your actions and the consequences of your actions on the service, not Vir-Pong.<br />
- Do not harass, abuse, or spam other players, or encourage other players to do so.<br />
- Do not scream, yell, threaten, or stalk other players, or encourage other players to do so.<br />

- Do not post links to websites that violate the Code of Conduct.<br />
- Donot give out personal information of other players (such as their real name, address, phone number, credit card number, etc.) in any way (including, without limitation, through voice chat or the names you create for your gamertag or mottos).

- Do not impersonate, harass, or defame Vir-Pong employees, moderators, or staff members.<br />
