		<h2 class="title">VirPong Created</h2>
		<p>Our fearless leader, Dr. Sawin collected twenty-one talented individuals from the University of Puget Sound converge their 
		   skills to produce a revolutionary Ping-Pong Game. The game will be called VirPong and will allow game users to run around 
		   with a Wii Remote while virtually playing the game on their personal cell phone.
		   The current gaming system will only be available for the IPhone and Android systems. Viewing will be available on the website as well!
		   We look forward to a fantastic relationship and may your VirPong experiences begin!</p>
