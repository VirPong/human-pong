Acceleration to position: pseudocode-Java-ish stuff

private float yPos
private float yVel
private float prevTime
private Timer theTimer

public float getPosition(float yAccel) {
	float newTime <= theTimer.getTime();
	float elapsedTime <= newTime - prevTime;
	float oldVel <= (elapsedTime * yAccel) + yVel;
	yPos <= elapsedTime * (oldVel + yVel) / 2 + yPos;
	return yPos;
}

Note that we don't know yet what kinds of numbers we'll be seeing
for the acceleration data. At some point, we'll translate the data
into ints instead of floats so everything will run faster.
